## What's This Package?

**dbt-azure-demo-source-ops** provides four simple operations to manage realistic demo source data for dbt projects:

- `demo_load_baseline` - Initialize with baseline data
- `demo_apply_delta` - Apply day 1/2/3 changes (simulate business activity)
- `demo_reset` - Truncate and reload baseline
- `demo_status` - Show current row counts

### Supported Platforms
- **DuckDB (Local)** - Local development (zero cloud costs)
- **MotherDuck** - Cloud collaboration with shared databases (free tier available)
- **Azure SQL** - Cloud demos with CDC/change tracking

## How This Differs from Traditional Demo Databases

### Traditional Demo Databases

Popular databases like **[AdventureWorks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure)** and **[Willibald](https://dwa-compare.info/en/start-2/)** are excellent for:

- Learning SQL queries and data transformations
- Building BI dashboards and reports
- Exploring schema design and normalization
- Practicing data modeling

**Key characteristic**: Static, complete datasets

### This Package: Data Engineering Focus

**dbt-azure-demo-source-ops** is designed for a different purpose:

- Learning **data integration patterns** (incremental loads, CDC, SCD Type 2)
- Testing **data pipeline orchestration** (Lakeflow Connect, Databricks workflows)
- Developing **change tracking strategies** (soft deletes, audit columns)
- Simulating **realistic source system evolution** over time
- Practicing **delta architecture patterns** in a controlled environment

**Key characteristic**: Dynamic, versioned source systems with reproducible state transitions

### Use Case Comparison

| Scenario                                 | Traditional Demo DB    | This Package                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| "How do I write a complex JOIN?"         | ✅ AdventureWorks      | ❌ Not the focus                            |
| "How do I practice complex SQL?"         | ✅ Willibald           | ❌ Not the focus                            |
| "How do I detect changed records?"       | ❌ Static data         | ✅ Apply deltas, observe changes            |
| "How do I test incremental loads?"       | ❌ No state evolution  | ✅ Apply Day 1, then Day 2, then Day 3      |
| "How does CDC work?"                     | ❌ No change tracking  | ✅ Azure SQL with change tracking enabled   |
| "How do I handle soft deletes?"          | ❌ No deleted records  | ✅ `deleted_at` column pattern              |
| "How do I test pipeline reset/recovery?" | ❌ Can't reset state   | ✅ `demo_reset` operation                   |
| "How do I practice Lakeflow Connect?"    | ❌ Static source       | ✅ DuckDB/MotherDuck as evolving source     |

### Complementary, Not Competing

You might use both:

- **Traditional demo DB**: "What insights can I derive from sales data?"
- **This package**: "How do I incrementally sync those sales from the source system?"

This package is for the **infrastructure layer** - the often-overlooked but critical work of reliably getting data from point A to point B as it evolves.
