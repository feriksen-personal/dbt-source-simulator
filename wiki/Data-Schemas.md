## Data Patterns

### Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)

Tables that change slowly over time:
- **customers**: New customers added, some deleted (soft delete)
- **products**: Price updates, occasionally discontinued
- **campaigns**: Rarely change once created

### Transactional Data

Tables with high insert volume:
- **orders**: New orders daily
- **order_items**: 1-5 items per order
- **payments**: One payment per order

### Append-Only Event Streams

Tables that only insert (no updates):
- **email_activity**: Email engagement events
- **web_sessions**: Website session logs
