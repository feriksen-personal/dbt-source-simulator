# Soda Core Data Contracts for jaffle_shop Database
#
# This file defines data quality checks for the jaffle_shop e-commerce database.
# Run these checks after loading baseline or applying deltas to verify data integrity.
#
# Usage:
#   # DuckDB/MotherDuck:
#   soda scan -d demo_source -c extras/soda/configuration.yml extras/soda/contracts/jaffle_shop.yml
#
#   # Azure SQL (ensure configuration.yml has database: jaffle_shop):
#   soda scan -d demo_source -c extras/soda/configuration.yml extras/soda/contracts/jaffle_shop.yml
#
# Expected row counts:
#   Baseline (Day 0): customers=100, products=20, orders=500, order_items=1200, payments=0
#   Day 1: customers=125, orders=560, order_items=1303, payments=272
#   Day 2: customers=147, orders=615, order_items=1387, payments=316
#   Day 3: customers=175, orders=680, order_items=1502, payments=374
